## Running the Program

1. **Compile** the code using a C++ compiler.
2. **Run** the executable file.

## User Interface

The program uses a text-based menu for user interaction. Users can choose from various options to perform different actions.

## File Handling

The program uses file I/O operations to store and retrieve account data. Account information is stored in a binary file named `account.dat`.

## Administrator Access

Certain functionalities, such as viewing all accounts and deleting accounts, require administrator access. The program prompts the user for a password to grant administrator privileges.

## Note

## Further Enhancements

- Implement error handling for user input.
- Add transaction history tracking.
- Implement security measures for user authentication and data encryption.
- Design a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more user-friendly experience.
